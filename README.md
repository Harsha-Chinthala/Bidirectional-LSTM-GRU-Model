# Bidirectional-LSTM-GRU-Model
This is a Sentiment Analysis Model
that leverages a hybrid model combining Bidirectional GRU
and LSTM networks. The integration of Bidirectional GRUs
allows the model to process sequential information efficiently
in both forward and backward directions, while the LSTM
component addresses the challenge of capturing long-term
dependencies in text. By combining these two architectures,
our approach aims to enhance the performance and reliability
of sentiment classification.
